# Task Tiles Project Design Notes

## Project Overview

- **Project Name**: Task Tiles
- **Current Status**: Production Ready → Enhancement Phase
- **Inspiration**: ClickUp (upgraded from Trello-inspired)
- **Vision**: Modern project management platform with comprehensive features

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT

⚠️ **ALL DOCUMENTATION AND CODE COMMENTS MUST BE IN ENGLISH**

- This is a mandatory requirement from the project specification
- All key decisions should be recorded in this file
- Keep documentation concise and actionable

## Current State Assessment (2025-01-05)

### ✅ **Completed Foundation (v1.0)**

**Core Architecture**

- ✅ Full-stack TypeScript application (React + Node.js + PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Modern development environment (Docker, pnpm, Dev Container)
- ✅ Production-ready deployment configuration
- ✅ Comprehensive API with 20+ endpoints and test coverage

**Functional Features**

- ✅ Board management with CRUD operations
- ✅ Column management with custom statuses
- ✅ Enhanced task system (assignee, priority, deadline, tags, etc.)
- ✅ Drag & drop functionality with optimistic updates
- ✅ Modern UI design with ClickUp-inspired styling

**Technical Implementation**

- ✅ Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- ✅ @dnd-kit for drag operations
- ✅ Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- ✅ React Context for state management
- ✅ RESTful API with validation and error handling

### 🚨 **Critical Gaps (vs ClickUp Standard)**

#### 1. **Information Density Problem**

```
Current: Task cards show minimal information (title only)
ClickUp: Rich cards with assignee, dates, priority, project info
Impact: Users must click to see critical task details
```

#### 2. **Missing Core Features**

```
Views: Only Board view (ClickUp has 6+ views)
User System: No authentication or user management
Collaboration: No real-time features or notifications
Project Structure: No Spaces/Projects hierarchy
Time Management: Basic deadline only, no time tracking
```

#### 3. **Architecture Limitations**

```
Single-tenant: No multi-user support
Static Data: No real-time updates
Limited Scale: No workspace/organization concepts
```

## Development Roadmap

### 🔥 **Phase 9: Information Density Enhancement (Week 1)**

**Priority: CRITICAL** | **Effort: 2-3 days** | **Impact: HIGH**

**Objectives:**

- Redesign task cards with rich information display
- Show assignee avatars, deadlines, priority indicators
- Implement hover states with additional details
- Add quick action buttons on cards

**Technical Changes:**

```typescript
// Expand TaskCard dimensions
- Current: Compact single-line layout
- Target: Multi-line layout with visual hierarchy

// Information Architecture
├── Header: Project# + Item Type + Priority Dot
├── Title: 2-line truncation with hover expansion
├── Meta: Assignee avatar + Name + Deadline
├── Footer: Tags + Estimate + Quick actions
└── Indicators: Overdue warning, blocked status
```

### 🎯 **Phase 10: Multi-View System (Weeks 2-3)**

**Priority: HIGH** | **Effort: 1-2 weeks** | **Impact: HIGH**

**Target Views:**

1. **List View**: Table format with sortable columns
2. **Calendar View**: Deadline-based scheduling
3. **Timeline View**: Simplified Gantt chart
4. **Table View**: Spreadsheet-like data management

**Implementation Strategy:**

```
├── View Router: URL-based view persistence
├── Shared Data Layer: Unified task filtering
├── View Components: Modular view implementations
└── View Settings: Per-view configuration storage
```

### 🔐 **Phase 11: User Management System (Weeks 4-6)**

**Priority: CRITICAL** | **Effort: 2-3 weeks** | **Impact: VERY HIGH**

**Authentication Architecture:**

```typescript
Database Schema:
├── Users (id, email, name, avatar, settings)
├── Workspaces (id, name, plan, settings)
├── Memberships (user_id, workspace_id, role)
├── Teams (id, workspace_id, name, description)
└── Team_Members (team_id, user_id, role)

API Endpoints:
├── Auth: /auth/login, /auth/register, /auth/refresh
├── Users: /users/profile, /users/settings
├── Workspaces: /workspaces/*, /workspaces/:id/members
└── Teams: /teams/*, /teams/:id/members
```

**Security Implementation:**

- JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- Role-based access control (Owner, Admin, Member, Guest)
- Workspace isolation and permissions
- API rate limiting and validation

### 🤝 **Phase 12: Real-time Collaboration (Weeks 7-8)**

**Priority: HIGH** | **Effort: 1-2 weeks** | **Impact: HIGH**

**Real-time Features:**

```
WebSocket Events:
├── Task Updates: Real-time task changes
├── Board Changes: Column updates, new tasks
├── User Presence: Who's viewing/editing
├── Notifications: @mentions, assignments
└── Typing Indicators: Live collaboration feedback
```

**Technical Stack:**

- Socket.io for WebSocket management
- Redis for session storage and pub/sub
- Event-driven architecture for scalability

### 📊 **Phase 13: Advanced Project Management (Weeks 9-12)**

**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Effort: 3-4 weeks** | **Impact: HIGH**

**Feature Expansion:**

```
Project Structure:
├── Spaces: Top-level organization
├── Projects: Work containers within spaces
├── Sprints: Time-boxed work cycles
└── Goals: Objective tracking

Time Management:
├── Time Tracking: Manual and automatic
├── Estimates: Task sizing and velocity
├── Deadlines: Multiple date types
└── Scheduling: Resource planning

Advanced Features:
├── Custom Fields: Flexible task properties
├── Automation: Rule-based task updates
├── Templates: Reusable project structures
└── Integrations: External tool connections
```
